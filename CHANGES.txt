 +  Added SPECIAL configuration constants HOUR, MIN, SEC and WDAY
 +  Added mention of showchain.pl to the Config::Manager manpage
 +  Corrected the description of "MakeDir()" in File.pm
 +  Script showchain.pl doesn't pipe output via "more" anymore
 +  Removed excessive indentation from the output of showconf.pl
 +  Now 'source' and 'line' attributes for $[SPECIAL]{HOME} and
    $[SPECIAL]{WHOAMI} are properly set

Version 1.6   28.06.2003

 Config::Manager::Report:

 +  The name and path of the default logfile can now be influenced
    (the "singleton()" class method now passes arguments to "new()")
 +  Changed the default path and filename of logfile objects
    (now uses the user login to discriminate further)
 +  Adapted the test suite accordingly
 +  Functions "Normalize()" and "MakeDir()" are now physically
    located in Config::Manager::Report
 +  The constructor now automatically creates the logfile's path
    (with "MakeDir()") if necessary
 +  Added new import targets ":aux" and ":ALL" (":aux" contains
    "Normalize" and "MakeDir", ":ALL" contains ":all" and ":aux")

 Config::Manager::File:

 +  Functions "Normalize()" and "MakeDir()" are now imported from
    Config::Manager::Report and re-exported
 +  Function "Normalize()" now also supports relative paths

 Config::Manager::Conf:

 +  Added the method "get_files()" to get the list of configuration
    files which led to the current configuration object, in the
    order they were read in
 +  Changed the method "get_all()", it now returns a list of
    anonymous arrays containing a flag, the name, the value, the
    source file and line number of each configuration constant
 +  Adapted the test suite accordingly

 scripts:

 +  Added the script "showchain.pl" to show the chain of
    configuration files which are read in for a given
    scope and user
 +  Changed the script "showconf.pl" to also show the file
    of origin and line number of each configuration constant

Version 1.5   09.06.2003

 +  Added constant $[SPECIAL]{PERL} which contains $^X

Version 1.4   18.05.2003

 +  Changed some wordings in Config::Manager::Report
 +  Fixed syntax error in Config::Manager::SendMail
 +  Improved the overview manual page "Config::Manager"
 +  Added "Normalize()" and "MakeDir()" to Config::Manager::File
 +  Added missing documentation parts to Config::Manager::File
 +  Config::Manager::File now localizes all global Perl variables
 +  Config::Manager::File now uses file locking (flock)
 +  Added new prerequisite "Fcntl" to Makefile.PL
 +  Removed the pointless file histories from all modules

Version 1.3   01.05.2003

 +  Replaced MD5 with Digest::MD5
 +  Made some cosmetic changes to error messages
    in Config::Manager::Conf
 +  Changed the test suite accordingly
 +  Fixed the broken images from version 1.2

Version 1.2   26.04.2003

 Config::Manager::Conf:

 +  Simplified and slightly corrected the code

 Config::Manager::Report:

 +  Does not automatically and forcibly produce
    a stack trace for errors and fatal messages anymore
 +  Now allows you to provide your own path and filename
    for log files; the previous behaviour continues to
    be the default if you don't
 +  Added a running number to the generated filename
    to make it unique even when log files are created
    in rapid succession; also added the year number
 +  Fixed some subtle bugs
 +  Now returns error messages instead of dying
 +  Now an inventory of all log files is kept which
    allows to close them all reliably at shutdown time
 +  Added a new "close()" method
 +  Now uses "Symbol" instead of "IO::File" (should
    therefore be slightly faster to load)

 General:

 +  Added the script "showconf.pl", a more versatile
    replacement for "listconf.pl"
 +  Changed all messages returned by this distribution
    from German to English (the documentation continues
    to be largely in German, though)
 +  Removed obsolete test driver code
 +  Changed "Makefile.PL" (IO::File => Symbol)
 +  Changed the documentation accordingly
 +  Changed the test suite accordingly
