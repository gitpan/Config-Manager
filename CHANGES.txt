Version history:
----------------

Version 1.4   18.05.2003

 +  Changed some wordings in Config::Manager::Report
 +  Fixed syntax error in Config::Manager::SendMail
 +  Improved the overview manual page "Config::Manager"
 +  Added "Normalize()" and "MakeDir()" to Config::Manager::File
 +  Added missing documentation parts to Config::Manager::File
 +  Config::Manager::File now localizes all global Perl variables
 +  Config::Manager::File now uses file locking (flock)

Version 1.3   01.05.2003

 +  Replaced MD5 with Digest::MD5
 +  Made some cosmetic changes to error messages
    in Config::Manager::Conf

Version 1.2   26.04.2003

 Config::Manager::Conf:

 +  Simplified and slightly corrected the code

 Config::Manager::Report:

 +  Does not automatically and forcibly produce
    a stack trace for errors and fatal messages anymore
 +  Now allows you to provide your own path and filename
    for log files; the previous behaviour continues to
    be the default if you don't
 +  Added a running number to the generated filename
    to make it unique even when log files are created
    in rapid succession; also added the year number
 +  Fixed some subtle bugs
 +  Now returns error messages instead of dying
 +  Now an inventory of all log files is kept which
    allows to close them all reliably at shutdown time
 +  Added a new "close()" method
 +  Now uses "Symbol" instead of "IO::File" (should
    therefore be slightly faster to load)

 General:

 +  Added the script "showconf.pl", a more versatile
    replacement for "listconf.pl"
 +  Changed all messages returned by this distribution
    from German to English (the documentation continues
    to be largely in German, though)
