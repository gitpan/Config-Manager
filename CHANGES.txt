Version history:
----------------

Version 1.2   26.04.2003

 Config::Manager::Conf:

 +  Simplified and slightly corrected the code

 Config::Manager::Report:

 +  Does not automatically and forcibly produce
    a stack trace for errors and fatal messages anymore
 +  Now allows you to provide your own path and filename
    for log files; the previous behaviour continues to
    be the default if you don't
 +  Added a running number to the generated filename
    to make it unique even when log files are created
    in rapid succession; also added the year number
 +  Fixed some subtle bugs
 +  Now returns error messages instead of dying
 +  Now an inventory of all log files is kept which
    allows to close them all reliably at shutdown time
 +  Added a new "close()" method
 +  Now uses "Symbol" instead of "IO::File" (should
    therefore be slightly faster to load)

 General:

 +  Added the script "showconf.pl", a more versatile
    replacement for "listconf.pl"
 +  Changed all messages returned by this distribution
    from German to English (the documentation continues
    to be largely in German, though)
 +  Removed obsolete test driver code
 +  Changed "Makefile.PL" (IO::File => Symbol)
 +  Changed the documentation accordingly
 +  Changed the test suite accordingly

Version 1.1   14.02.2003

 +  Added more documentation
 +  Added missing license files
 +  Added working example configuration files
 +  Added another test file
