Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl version 5.000 or higher.


Preliminary steps for use with Perl prior to version 5.002:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" and change the line

    'VERSION_FROM'      => 'Manager.pm',
to
    'VERSION'           => '1.0',

Also edit the file "t/00____version.t" and change the line

    use Config::Manager 1.0;
to
    use Config::Manager;


Preliminary steps for use with ActiveState's port of Perl 5.005:
----------------------------------------------------------------

(For the Win32 platform)

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" and remove all of the "#" characters
which currently comment out the attributes "ABSTRACT", "AUTHOR"
and "CAPI".


Installation:
-------------

=============================================================================
ALWAYS unpack and build Perl modules OUTSIDE the Perl source and installation
tree! (You might otherwise inadvertently corrupt your Perl installation!)
=============================================================================

Quick installation guide for experienced users:
-----------------------------------------------

    UNIX:                 Win32/Borland C++:      Win32/MS Visual C++:
    =====                 ==================      ====================

    > perl Makefile.PL    > perl Makefile.PL      > perl Makefile.PL
    > make                > dmake                 > nmake
    > make test           > dmake test            > nmake test
    > make install        > dmake install         > nmake install

Detailed installation guide:
----------------------------

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("cd Config-Manager-1.0").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL" (or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5
    binary is).

    This will create a "Makefile" with the appropriate parameters for your
    system (for instance, where the install directories are, and so on).

 3) Type "make".

    (For installation under Windows NT/95, use "dmake" (Borland C++) or
    "nmake" (MS Visual C++) instead!)

    This will create a dynamically linkable library file that will be linked
    to Perl later, at runtime, provided your system supports dynamic linking.

    Please refer to the MakeMaker documentation for instructions on how
    to build a new Perl with statically linked libraries (invoke "perldoc
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for this), if your system does NOT support dynamic
    linking!

 4) Now issue "make test" (or "dmake test" or "nmake test", respectively).

    The output should look somewhat like this:


 5) At last, type "make install" (or "dmake install", "nmake install").

 7) Enjoy!
